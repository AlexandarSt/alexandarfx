The first in the chain is a completely analog chorus effect, which is a clone of the legendary Boss CE2 with the addition of speed mode while the other in the chain is a two-channel delay effect with two mix controls.</p><p>The device is equipped with state-of-the-art relay bypass system that allows for long, safe and elegant operation without replacing the true bypass switch. The system uses a metal clickless key and a relay electronic system for switching the state that is being used by more and more foreign boutique manufacutrers.</p>',

Not active in standard delay mode.</li><li> Depth – Determines the depth of the modulation effect</li><li> Speed ​​- Specifies the speed of the modulation effect</li><li> Dry – Wet / Dry – This manual switch manipulates with stereo output n 2 thus allowing a clean output with no effect (dry) or full effect on the output (Wet / Dry)</li><li> Tb / Buffer – This manual switch affects the bypass mode of the device, which can be a true bypass without any effect on the signal or buffer that changes the impedance and refreshes the signal, raising the level of higher and medium frequencies that are lost due to the impact of long cables.</li></ul><p>The device is made from high quality parts for superior sound and long lasting work.</p>',

In this way gain is all the way down, volume control almost all the way up and tone control adjusted to your liking.</p><p>Standalone guitar overdrive. In this way every control is set accordingly to your liking and needs of your guitar and amplifier.Alexander Fx Clone Centaur has built in a voltage charge pump that raises voltage from 9v to 18v for high headroom clean boost made this pedal famous.</p><p>Alexander Fx Clone Centaur goes step forward that the original with built in modern Relay true bypass system with clickless momentary footswitch for more longevity.</p><p>Power: this pedal requires 9v negative ground voltage most of the pedals on market use so it is a pedalboard friendly pedal. Dimensions are 120mmx67mm so this makes this pedal even more pedalboard friendly that the original.</p><p>With purchase of this pedal you get 9v battery adapter you can use on most of your guitar pedals.</p>',
