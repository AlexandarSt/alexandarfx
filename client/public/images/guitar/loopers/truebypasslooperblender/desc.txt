Description
Bass guitarists always had problems with effects for guitarists because of the design that does not deal with the frequencies of bass guitar. There’s a lot of overdrive, distortion and fuzz effects that sound great on the guitar and need very little to sound great on bass guitars only if there would be no bass frequency losses.

Also, there are effects that are intended for bass guitars, but which do not give satisfactory results in lower tunings because there are losses on what it is popularly called the “low end”.

Now about the famous blend control that some bass pedals own, others do not. With the help of a true bypass looper blender, bass guitarists will be able to connect to a loop favorite drive / dist / fuzz pedal that does not have blend control and adjust the appropriate dry / wet ratio to get satisfactory results and avoid bass frequencies. After that, the drive / fuzz pedal remains on nonstop and starts or bypasses with true bypass looper.

The device can be upgraded with the most up-to-date relay bypass system for a price of 20 EUR.

This device comes with mandatory warranty.
