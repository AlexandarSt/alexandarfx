Description
New Looper feedback model we offer. This is the standard Alexander FX Feedback looper, which has been upgraded with a very important volume function and a footswitch that switches from True bypass mode to Feedback loop mode.

Feedback looper / True bypass looper is a pedal that allows you to connect and manipulate an unlimited number of pedals in the loop. Feedback loop mode allows the signal to pass through the chain and returns the signal back to the beginning of the chain, thereby creating an infinite loop and creating very interesting effects that depend on the type of effects associated with the loop.

The pedal is made of high quality parts.
