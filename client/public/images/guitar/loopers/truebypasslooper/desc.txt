Description
Alexander FX True bypass looper is a device that can help you in two ways:

– If you have multiple pedals in your setup that you want to start at the same time during certain sections, true bypass looper can help you to avoid dancing on the scene.

– True bypass looper can help you if you have a pedal in your setup that is not a true bypass and has a poorly designed buffer that triggers tone sucking when it’s turned off. With true bypass looper, you can isolate it and start it as needed without any degradation of your base tone.

This pedal comes with mandatory warranty.
