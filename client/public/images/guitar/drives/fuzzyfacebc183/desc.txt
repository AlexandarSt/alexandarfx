Description
The Alexander FX Fuzzy Face BC183 is a recreation of the classic fuzz circuit from the late 1960s when company called Arbiter switched from germanium to silicon technology to create Fuzz Face effects. Fuzzy face BC183 has an internal trim for fine tuning and biasing transistors that, unlike germanium ones, are not subject to the influence of the temperature of the room in which it is played. This effect became known by Jimi Hendrix, who in the final phase of his life and work (Band of Gypsys Phase) turned completely to fuzz face effects with silicon transistors.
