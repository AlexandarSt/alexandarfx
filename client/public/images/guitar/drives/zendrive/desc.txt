Description
The pedal inspired by one of the best-designed drive pedals of our time. It is a overdrive that recreates the sound of the legendary Dumble amplifiers that have been celebrated with their sounds in the 1970s and 1980s.

In addition to standard gain, volume and tone controls, the device has a voice control with the help of which sound modeling is raised to a far higher level. Voice control is a pregain tone control that determines which frequency signals will be amplified and cluttered. In this way, you get better design of the guitar signal and adaptation to different types of music. The device is built from high-quality parts for high quality sound and long lasting work.

This device comes with one-year warranty.
