Description
Upgraded clone of the original Tube screamer model, i.e. Ibanez TS version 808. An excellent midrange boost pedal can be used as a standalone drive on clean channels for blues and rock amplifiers but also as initially predicted as a gain booster OD channel on amplifiers.

The pedal is in relation to the original true bypass and can be upgraded with the latest relay bypass system, which has been done by the most famous manufacturers of guitar effects such as Wampler pedals, Visual Sound, etc.

This pedal is upgraded with FAT mode for tone blurring and can be upgraded to other options and modes such as 6-7 voicing / clipping options which are replaced by a rotary switch, 18 volt mod, multiple channels, and such. We are open to any collaboration, itâ€™s your choice to create what you need to create your original sound.
