Description
A versatile pedal designed for musicians who need Marshall sound. You can attach this high quality pedal to most club amplifiers and get a marshall sound.

This device is based on the MI audio Crunch Box distortion v3 but has been changed in terms of Gain and Volume control. The original Crunch box is known for getting too quickly into the territory of distortion and saturation so it’s hard to adjust it with the pot if you play songs with less drive, classic rock, hard rock, funk rock, and so on.

Our team solved this with the help of the Boost Cut Switch, which in the basic mode – to some extent – reduces the maximum drive that can be obtained with the gain path, so sweep gain pot is far better and Crunch drive can adapt to any playing style much easier, from a lightweight blues to the strongest metal with a lot of gain, playing solos with tones that last for ever and ever.

We also offer an upgrade to the device with the most advanced relay bypass system.
