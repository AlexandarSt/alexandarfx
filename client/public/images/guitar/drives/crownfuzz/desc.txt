Alexander FX Crown Fuzz is the latest and most sophisticated fuzz model we have in our store. It is a device based on a brilliant non-commercial project designed by David Rolo from Belgium, which contains the following controls:

– Volume, Gain and Tone – standard controls that do not need much explanation.

– Stab – Stability, allows for a lot of tone duration at the maximum and damped fuzz tones to a minimum. It can be used in both pedal, basic and Octave mode.

– Oct down – Level control lower octave. Can be used only if the Octave mode is started with the on-pedal switch.

– Oct Up – Level controls multiple octaves. Can be used only if the Octave mode is started with the help of a on-pedal switch.

The device is equipped with state-of-the-art relay bypass system for long-lasting work and elegant clickless start with the help of a metal key and an electronic status switching system.
