Description
Alexander FX Glory Drive is a clone of JHS Morning Glory Overdrive, which has been upgraded by the Marshall Bluesbraker clone.

It’s a very good design that uses a HI-FI IC chip – used in Zendrive in recent years.

This pedal is a mid-gain overdrive with three controls for adjusting the color of the sound and a toggle switch with which it can be further twisted or sharpened by tone manipulation.

The device is suitable for rock, hard rock and blues as a standalone drive or as gain boost for amplifiers.

The original pedal uses a mechanical true bypass switch. As an additional option, We offer upgrades with the latest relay bypass system for a long, safe and elegant start of the pedal.
