Description
Alexander FX Fuzzy Face is a blend of a classic effect from the late sixties and a modern upgrade for as much versatility as possible and a higher quality tone. It’s a Silicon Fuzz Face with our transistor combination and a mild modification of the electronic circuit that provides classic Fuzz Face tone, “Gated” Fuzz, Overdrive Fuzz and classic full sounding overdrive.

What distinguishes this Fuzz Face derivative apart from the combination of a transistor is the Bias Potentiometer, which changes the voltage of the Q2 transistor and thus makes a large number of variations and colors of the fuzz and overdrive sound.

Alexander FX Fuzzy Face is a negative ground in terms of power supply so it can be powered along with 99% of the guitar effects that exist today on the market, there is no need to purchase special power supplies, as is the case with some Fuzz Face models that are positive ground.
