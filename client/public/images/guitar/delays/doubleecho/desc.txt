Description
The Alexander FX Double Echo presents two completely independent pedals in one case. What you can get with this concept are two independent delay, rhythm and solo stocks as well as the ability to stack two delay effects.

Simultaneously using two delay pedals (stacking) you get great sound features that you can not get using a single delay effect.

The device can be upgraded with the latest relay bypass system if you wish. The price of the upgrade is 10 EUR per effect.

By purchasing the Alexander FX Double Echo effect, you get a warranty for one year and you will receive any service in the future.
