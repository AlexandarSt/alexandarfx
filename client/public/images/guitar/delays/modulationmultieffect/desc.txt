Description
The Echo Modulation Multieffect is a blend of two well-proven Alexander FX pedals that are the essentials of most of the pedalbord at the end of the chain. The first in the chain is a completely analog chorus effect, which is a clone of the legendary Boss CE2 with the addition of speed mode while the other in the chain is a two-channel delay effect with two mix controls.

The device is equipped with state-of-the-art relay bypass system that allows for long, safe and elegant operation without replacing the true bypass switch. The system uses a metal clickless key and a relay electronic system for switching the state that is being used by more and more foreign boutique manufacutrers.
