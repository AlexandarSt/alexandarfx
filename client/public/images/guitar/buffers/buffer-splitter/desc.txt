Description
Creating and selling a very important pedal that is necessary at the beginning of the chain right after guitar and guitar cable to maintain the basic guitar signal. The pedal has a very high input impedance, uses Jfet transistors so that the excellent and preserved guitar sound can be obtained even if you use cables longer than 10m.

A comment by one of the musicians who bought this pedal was that his sound was far more present in the mix and that he was not even aware that his guitar cords and pedals had crushed the tone to that extent. Only when you try the buffer in the chain you will see how it really affects your tone and how much it is needed.
