Description
The Alexandar Fx Integrated Booster is an upgraded clone of the legendary Tc electronic Integrated Preamp made popular in recent years by metal band Mesuggah.

Controls are:

Level: Determines the volmue level of the output signal (volume, gain)
Bass, Treble: active tone controls (+ -15db)
9v / 18v switch: The device was upgraded by a 9v input voltage doubler because it proved in practice that the Tc Integrated Preamp works better at higher voltages when the headroom is enlarged. This add-on allows you to use your standard pedal-board power of 9v and to select whether to double the voltage of the power supplying the pedal or not with the switch.

The device can also be upgraded with the latest relay bypass system for long-lasting operation and a more elegant start.

With the Alexandar Fx Integrated Booster you get a warranty and you will be provided with any kind of service in the future.
