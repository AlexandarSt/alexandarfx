Description
If you want to upgrade your Boss SD-1 to the Marshall Sound “Beast”, then this modification is for you. The aim of this modification is to improve the Taiwanese model Boss SD-1 with a noticeable void in the middle spectrum, a sharp sound in high spectrum and uninterrupted sound in the lower spectrum, or bass.

With this modification, the sound moves to the higher rank of OD pedals and achieves the following:

– Overdrive gets a Marshall character and a characteristic growling characteristic of this type of amplifier.
– The bass gets better.
– The middle tones are far more noticeable and, after modification, they come to life.
– Twins are rounded.
– The sound generally becomes warmer.

In addition to this modification, We also offer the installation of relay true bypass system, and after its incorporation the pedal stops affecting and degrading your bypass sound.
